  scm-ldap-plugin
</h1>

This plugin provides an Authentication for SCM manager using LDAP.

## Build and testing

The plugin can be compiled and packaged with the following tasks:

- build - `./gradlew build` - creates the final plugin bundle (smp package) in the build/lib folder
- check - `./gradlew check` - executes tests for Java and JavaScript
- clean - `./gradlew clean` - removes the build directory (should be used sparingly)

For the development and testing the `run` task of the plugin can be used:

- run - `./gradlew run` - starts scm-manager with the plugin pre installed.

If the plugin was started with `./gradlew run`, the default browser of the os should be automatically opened.
If the browser does not start automatically, start it manually and go to [http://localhost:8081/scm](http://localhost:8081/scm).

In this mode each change to web files (src/main/js or src/main/webapp), should trigger a reload of the browser with the made changes.

### Test-setup
To test this plugin against a ldap you may use a [preconfigured ldap inside a docker container](https://github.com/rroemhild/docker-test-openldap): 
```
docker pull rroemhild/test-openldap
docker run --privileged -d -p 389:389 rroemhild/test-openldap
```

Or simply use `docker-compose`:
```
docker-compose up
```

To connect against this ldap container you must set the following settings in your global ldap configuration:
* Select Profile => `Custom`
* Set Host URL to `ldap://localhost:10389`
* Set Base DN to `dc=planetexpress,dc=com`
* Set Connection DN to `cn=admin,dc=planetexpress,dc=com`
* Set the Connection Password to `GoodNewsEveryone`
* Set search filter to `(&(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)(uid={0}))`
* Set group search filter to `(&(objectClass=groupOfUniqueNames)(uniqueMember={0}))`

Now you can test the connection with username `professor` and password `professor`.
